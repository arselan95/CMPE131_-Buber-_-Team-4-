- BuberApp.java (Main class)

- logic : two array Lists 'userbike' and 'rentedbike' are used to store bike information.
	the functional requirements that work for now: 
	1> user can add bike and location. 
	2> customer can rent bike and it would give the hourly rate , and when the bike is due.
	3> both arraylists, also show when bikes are available and which bikes are rented out.

- input.txt: has all the inputs when I ran BuberApp.java
- output.txt: displays the console outputs.
